# newrelic.install Ansible Role

`newrelic.install` is an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) that will help you scale your New Relic observability efforts. It is currently in an experimental phase.

Through this ansible role, we have included Linux and Windows support for New Relic's `infrastructure` and `logs` integrations.

Please, check out the sections below for details on installation, how to get started, role's variables, dependencies and an example ansible `playbook` showcasing this role's usage.

If you need help with Ansible for Windows OS, take a look at [Setting up a Windows Host](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_setup.html), from the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/) site.

## Installation

### ansible-galaxy

**Coming soon**: `ansible-galaxy install newrelic.install`

### Manual

Run `make` in the project root to copy this repo to `~/.ansible/roles/newrelic.install`, enabling the role to behave as though it were installed from Galaxy.

## Getting Started

After installing, include the `newrelic.install` role in a new or existing playbook. For example:

```
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: newrelic.install
      vars:
        targets:
          - infra
          - logs
```

Ensure that the following environment variables are set in your terminal before running the playbook:

- `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`
- `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `NEW_RELIC_REGION`

## Variables

### Environment variables

Values are read from environment in [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml)

- `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`
- `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `NEW_RELIC_REGION`

### Role variables

#### `targets` **(Required)**

List of targeted installs to run on hosts. Available options are listed in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml)

#### `tags` (Optional)

Key-value pairs of tags passed to the installation.

#### `install_timeout_seconds` (Optional)

Sets timeout for installation task. Overrides the default timeout of 600s.

#### `verbosity` (Optional)

Verbosity options for the installation (`debug` or `trace`). Writes verbose output to a log file on the host.

### Defaults

Set in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml):

- `cli_install_url`
- `cli_install_download_location`
- `target_name_map`
- `verbosity_on_log_file_path_linux`
- `verbosity_on_log_file_path_windows`
- `default_install_timeout_seconds`

## Dependencies

Python requirements: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

Ansible requirements: [requirements.yml](requirements.yml)

## Example Playbook

```
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: newrelic.install
      vars:
        targets:
          - infra
          - logs
        tags:
          environment: production
        install_timeout_seconds: 1000
        verbosity: debug
